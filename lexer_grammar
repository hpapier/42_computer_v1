    -> if action \*\ before throw errors
    -> create an action \substraction\ and attach it a need action \number\
-> number
    -> if before there is an action \sqrt\ or \indeterminate\, create an action \degree_term\ action
    -> get the number enterely and create an action \number\
-> space
    -> pass
-> sign ^
    -> if action \indeterminate\ is before 
    -> create action \sqrt\
-> sign *
    -> if action \number\ before, create action \op_mutliply\
-> sing X
    -> create action \indeterminate\ with _next_action_needed_ : \
